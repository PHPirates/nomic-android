# Terminal for the Nomic game on Android

Initial rules as by Peter Suber from [here](https://legacy.earlham.edu/~peters/writing/nomic.htm#initial set).

As Douglas R. Hofstadter mentioned in Metamagical Themas,

> Ideally, perhaps, all rules should be entered in a computer, with
> a terminal for each player; amendments could then be incorporated instantly into the
> main text, with a corresponding adjustment to the numerical order.
